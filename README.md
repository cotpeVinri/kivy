Thirdly, downloading torrents is unreliable and inefficient. You might not find the torrent you are looking for or it might be incomplete or outdated. You might also have to deal with slow download speeds, broken links, corrupted files, or poor video quality.
  
Therefore, instead of looking for a free torrent download of JavaScript Essential Training, you should consider getting a subscription to Lynda.com or using their free trial offer.
